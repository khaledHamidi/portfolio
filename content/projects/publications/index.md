## Abstract

This article eliminates the need for sensors used in adjusting the measurement amount. A filling machine that quantifies ingredients using a mechanical mechanism that lifts offers design and manufacturing. The machine is suitable for coarse or granular with capacity up to 250ml customized to suit the materials and controlled by an electro-pneumatic system. Couple An upright cylindrical container moved by an effective cylinder was used. Container on top It is filled directly from the tank through the opening and when emptied, it is displaced horizontally and moves into the tank. Due to the weight of the materials, the bottom lid opens, which causes the container to be filled. One The conveyor belt was designed and operated by a DC motor using a driver circuit. Process, by an Arduino uno microcontroller with an infrared (IR) sensor and conveyor belt system It is automated. The opening and closing movement of the cylinder is a 5/3 motor that receives a signal from the control unit. It is controlled by a solenoid valve. Additionally, the design of the machine is designed for accessibility and compatibility. is customized and all components are 3D printed on a 200x200 mm construction site or job site can be produced. The open source nature of the design and software includes improvements made by the community and encourages adaptations and collaborates for continuous improvement and innovation in automated packaging systems Promotes a caring environment. experiments on different materials have been evaluated positively.
