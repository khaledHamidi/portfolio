 ## Overview

I designed this program to help teachers of the YÃ–S curriculum for the El-Osmanli Education Center. The application aims to enhance the teaching of mathematics by leveraging smart pen screens and projectors instead of traditional whiteboards.

## Features

This application enables teachers to:

1. **Capture Questions**: Teachers can capture questions directly from the screen, allowing for easy display and sharing.

2. **Blank Page Explanation**: Captured questions can be transferred to a blank page, providing a clean slate for detailed explanations and solutions.

3. **Memorization Support**: The application offers the possibility of memorizing and storing explanations, enabling teachers to revisit and review previous lessons or demonstrations.

## How It Works

The program utilizes smart pen screens and a projector to create an interactive teaching environment. Instead of a traditional whiteboard, the teacher can display questions or problems on the screen and then transfer them to a blank page for further explanation and solving.

During the lesson, the teacher can capture the question from the screen and transfer it to a blank page. This blank page serves as a digital canvas, allowing the teacher to provide step-by-step explanations, work through solutions, and illustrate concepts using the smart pen.

The application also offers the ability to memorize and store these explanations, enabling teachers to revisit and review previous lessons or demonstrations as needed.

## Conclusion

This program for educational pen screens is a powerful tool designed to enhance the teaching of mathematics and facilitate interactive lessons. By combining the capabilities of smart pen screens, projectors, and the application's features, teachers can create engaging and memorable learning experiences for their students.
