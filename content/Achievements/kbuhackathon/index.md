# ASP.NET Hackathon Winner: Khaled's Order Management System

In a remarkable achievement, I emerged as the winner of a prestigious hackathon organized by Karabuk University's SAVUNMA TEKNOLOJİLERİ KULÜBÜ (Defense Technologies Club) and sponsored by Enoca. The intense hackathon event lasted from 5 PM until 6 AM the following morning, attracting over 100 talented competitors.

## Order Management System (OMS)

Khaled's winning project was an Order Management System (OMS) built using cutting-edge technologies and following industry best practices. The system was developed using the following techniques:

- **ASP.NET Core 6 API**
- **Repository Service Pattern**
- **MSSQL Code FIRST**
- **N-Tier Architecture**
- **API Endpoint URL structure Best Practices**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **Global Error Handling**
- **Custom Action Filter**
- **Login System Authentication and Authorization** (for master, company, and guest users)
- **Global Error Handling**
- **Caching**
- **Migrations** (Project.Data)

The project was structured following the N-Tier architecture pattern, with the following components:

- **Project.API** - Presentation Layer (.NET Core Web API project)
- **Project.Core**
- **Project.Data**
- **Project.Service**
- **Project.Common**

## Design Patterns and Architectural Principles

The Order Management System exemplified best practices in software design and architecture, incorporating the following patterns and principles:

- **CQRS Design Pattern**, utilizing Mediatr and Onion Architecture
- **Custom Repositories** on default repositories with Data Transfer Object (DTO) for Queries and Commands
- **AutoMapper**
- **Unit of Work Pattern**

my project is available on [github](https://github.com/khaledHamidi/OMS), showcasing his expertise in developing robust and scalable enterprise-level applications using modern technologies and architectural patterns.

my achievement in winning this hackathon is a testament to his exceptional skills and dedication to software engineering. His Order Management System serves as an outstanding example of best practices in ASP.NET Core development and demonstrates his ability to deliver high-quality solutions under intense time constraints.
