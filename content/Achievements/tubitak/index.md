My project "Development of Multi-Purpose Autonomous Mobile Robot for Education and Research Works" has received funding from [TÜBİTAK](https://tubitak.gov.tr/) under the 2209-A University Students Research Projects Support Program.

The goal is to design and develop an autonomous robotic platform that can perform various tasks independently and integrate with external systems. TÜBİTAK's support through this prestigious program will enable me to pursue this groundbreaking idea and contribute to scientific knowledge and technological innovation.
