## Project Overview

This project involved designing and implementing a window control system to protect homes from dust and sand during sandstorms, a common occurrence in Saudi Arabia. The system works by automatically closing the windows when a sandstorm is detected, preventing dust and sand from entering the home.

The system comprises sensors to detect sandstorms and a motor mechanism to open and close the windows. It also includes a notification feature that sends short messages to the homeowner's phone when a sandstorm is detected and the windows are being closed.

## Features

- Sandstorm detection sensors
- Automated window opening and closing mechanism
- Real-time notification system for homeowners
- Energy-efficient and low-maintenance design
