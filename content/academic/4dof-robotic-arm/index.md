## Filtering and Classification of Shapes Chromatically Using a 4.DOF Robotic Arm

## Abstract

Sorting and classifying products can be challenging for humans, especially in unhealthy conditions. Manual sorting also leads to occasional errors. Therefore, the use of a robotic arm for sorting and classifying based on specific criteria is important in various industries. This study presents a solution for color-based shape sorting and classification using a four-degree-of-freedom robotic arm controlled by Raspberry Pi. Image processing algorithms determine the color of the object to be classified, and accordingly, the arm is commanded to pick it up and place it in the designated location for that color.
